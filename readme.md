# MyMusicWorld Project

This is a project I had been tasked to make at my Uni using mostly PHP

## The idea

My idea is to utilize Spotifys API to simulate a website about reviewing, sharing, and talking about music - similar to rateyourmusic.com

## The goal

My goal is to learn API connection and utilise it effectively in PHP, expirience and immerse myself in PHP development, learn SQLi and how it connects with PHP and to make and design a full stack web app by myself
